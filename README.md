## About Renault

Renault S.A. is a French multinational automobile manufacturer established in 1899. The company has played a significant role in automotive history and continues to be one of the leading vehicle manufacturers globally.

## Generations

### Early Years (1899-1944)

Founded by Louis Renault and his brothers Marcel and Fernand, the company began by building small cars that quickly gained popularity for their innovation. During this period, Renault expanded from a small workshop to a major manufacturer, producing taxis, buses, and military vehicles. World War I saw Renault manufacturing light tanks and aircraft engines, establishing its reputation for engineering excellence. The company nationalized following World War II after Louis Renault's death.

### Post-War Expansion (1945-1979)

After becoming a state-owned enterprise, Renault focused on rebuilding France's economy with affordable cars like the 4CV. The company expanded internationally and introduced iconic models like the Dauphine, Renault 4, and Renault 5 (Le Car in North America). This period saw Renault establish factories across Europe, South America, and Africa, becoming a truly global automaker. The company pioneered the hatchback concept and front-wheel drive layouts that would become industry standards.

### Privatization and Global Alliance (1980-1999)

The 1980s brought financial challenges, leading to restructuring and eventual privatization in 1996. Renault introduced successful models like the Espace (Europe's first modern minivan), Clio, and Twingo. The company refocused on core markets and innovative designs, establishing a distinctive design language and emphasis on safety. This period ended with preparations for global partnerships.

### Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance (2000-Present)

In 1999, Renault formed an alliance with Nissan, later expanded to include Mitsubishi in 2016, creating one of the world's largest automotive groups. The alliance has focused on shared platforms, electrification, and autonomous driving technologies. Notable modern Renault vehicles include the electric ZOE, Captur crossover, and revival of the Alpine sports car brand. Renault has committed to an ambitious electrification strategy while maintaining its reputation for distinctive design and innovation.
